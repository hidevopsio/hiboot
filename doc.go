/*Package hiboot is a web/cli app application framework

Hiboot is a cloud native web and cli application framework written in Go.

Hiboot integrates the popular libraries but make them simpler, easier to use.
It borrowed some of the Spring features like dependency injection, aspect oriented programming, and auto configuration.
You can integrate any other libraries easily by auto configuration with dependency injection support. hiboot-data is the
typical project that implement customized hiboot starters. see https://godoc.org/github.com/hidevopsio/hiboot-data

Overview

	Web MVC - (Model-View-Controller).
	Auto Configuration - pre-create instance with properties configs for dependency injection.
	Dependency injection - with struct tag name `inject:""` or Constructor func.

Introduction to Hiboot

One of the most significant feature of Hiboot is Dependency Injection. Hiboot implements JSR-330 standard.

Let's say that we have two implementations of AuthenticationService, below will explain how does Hiboot work.

	type AuthenticationService interface {
		Authenticate(credential Credential) error
	}

	type basicAuthenticationService struct {
	}

	func newBasicAuthenticationService() AuthenticationService {
		return &basicAuthenticationService{}
	}

	func (s *basicAuthenticationService) Authenticate(credential Credential) error {
		// business logic ...
		return nil
	}

	type oauth2AuthenticationService struct {
	}

	func newOauth2AuthenticationService() AuthenticationService {
		return &oauth2AuthenticationService{}
	}

	func (s *oauth2AuthenticationService) Authenticate(credential Credential) error {
		// business logic ...
		return nil
	}

	func init() {
		app.Register(newBasicAuthenticationService, newOauth2AuthenticationService)
	}

Field Injection

In Hiboot the injection into fields is triggered by `inject:""` struct tag. when inject tag is present
on a field, Hiboot tries to resolve the object to inject by the type of the field. If several implementations
of the same service interface are available, you have to disambiguate which implementation you want to be
injected. This can be done by naming the field to specific implementation.

	type userController struct {
		at.RestController

		BasicAuthenticationService AuthenticationService	`inject:""`
		Oauth2AuthenticationService AuthenticationService	`inject:""`
	}

	func newUserController() {
		return &userController{}
	}

	func init() {
		app.Register(newUserController)
	}

Constructor Injection

Although Field Injection is pretty convenient, but the Constructor Injection is the first-class citizen, we
usually advise people to use constructor injection as it has below advantages,

	* It's testable, easy to implement unit test.
	* Syntax validation, with syntax validation on most of the IDEs to avoid typo.
	* No need to use a dedicated mechanism to ensure required properties are set.

	type userController struct {
		at.RestController

		basicAuthenticationService AuthenticationService
	}

	// Hiboot will inject the implementation of AuthenticationService
	func newUserController(basicAuthenticationService AuthenticationService) {
		return &userController{
			basicAuthenticationService: basicAuthenticationService,
		}
	}

	func init() {
		app.Register(newUserController)
	}
