/* Notes:
   We use the id as the signature of the connection because with the custom IDGenerator
	 the developer can share this ID with a database field, so we want to give the oportunnity to handle
	 his/her websocket connections without even use the connection itself.

	 Another question may be:
	 Q: Why you use Server as the main actioner for all of the connection actions?
	 	  For example the Server.Disconnect(connID) manages the connection internal fields, is this code-style correct?
	 A: It's the correct code-style for these type of applications and libraries, Server manages all, the connnection's functions
	 should just do some internal checks (if needed) and push the action to its parent, which is the Server, the Server is able to
	 remove a connection, the rooms of its connected and all these things, so in order to not split the logic, we have the main logic
	 here, in the Server, and let the connection with some exported functions whose exists for the per-connection action user's code-style.

	 Ok my english are s** I can feel it, but these comments are mostly for me.
